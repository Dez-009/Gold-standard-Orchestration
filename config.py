"""Execution tuning parameters controlling agent timeouts and retries.

The executor uses ``AGENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` to cancel slow agent calls. When a
timeout or failure occurs, it will retry up to ``AGENT_MAX_RETRIES`` times with
an increasing backoff.  Tweaking these values lets operators balance response
latency with resiliency to transient errors.
