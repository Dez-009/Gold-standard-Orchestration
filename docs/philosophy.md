## 💡 Our Mission

Vida Coach is not just another AI app.
It is a living, learning **Life Companion** designed to support human growth.
We are building:

- A system that listens.
- A system that adapts.
- A system that remembers.
- A system that holds people accountable with empathy.
- A system that nudges when necessary, but always respects agency.

## 🧠 The Architecture That Thinks

Every line of code is designed to serve **contextual intelligence**:

- ✅ **AI Core (GPT-4o)**  
    _Guided by structured prompts, Vida uses memory and behavioral reflection to guide users._

- ✅ **Context Memory**  
    _Sessions, journals, goals — Vida weaves user history into every coaching response._

- ✅ **Health Monitoring**  
    _The system constantly checks its own pulse — ready for real-world deployment._
