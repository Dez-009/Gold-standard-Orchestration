# Vida Coach App Docs (For Everyone!)

## What is Vida Coach?
Vida Coach is an app that helps you with your goals, habits, and wellness. It lets you track your progress, write journals, get advice from AI, and manage your accountâ€”all in one place!

## What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is like a menu for apps. It lets different programs talk to each other. For example, when you use Vida Coach on your phone or computer, the app uses the API to save your journal, check your goals, or get advice from the AI coach.

## Overview
- Vida Coach helps you:
  - Create an account
  - Write and read journals
  - Set and track goals
  - Get AI-powered coaching
  - Manage your account
  - And more!

## Getting Started
- You need Python 3.11+ and Docker (or just use the app online if you have it)
- If you want to run it yourself, you need some secret codes (called environment variables) for things like the database and AI
- To start the app, you usually run a command like:
  ```bash
  ./docker-start.sh dev
  ```
- To see the API menu (docs), go to: http://localhost:8000/docs

## How Login Works
- You make an account with your email and password
- You log in and get a special code (called a token)
- You use this code to do things like write journals or set goals

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```
- The app will give you a token. Use it like this:
```http
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```
